In this cool and dynamic website on super heros, you can add a new superhero, you can search for an existing superhero for which I've used binary search algorithm While you are adding a new super hero, you can experience the validations, i.e., if superhero name or alter ego fields are left empty, it shows appropriate alert message. Even in case of adding an existing superhero appropriate alert message is shown I've used the concept of javascript objects and arrays to store the superhero names and their corresponding code in number format For better user experience and as an element of extra styling, hovering on superhero names shows their real names
